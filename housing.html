<h1>Ellen's On and Off Campus Housing Breakdown</h1>
<p>If you use this information, maybe you will also find yourself bawling to <a href="https://youtu.be/MmW3hF-iKg8">"Rivers and Roads"</a>
 by The Head and The Heart in a 10x16 foot concrete cell with 20 of your closest friends 
because you know you'll never live in such a tight-knit community setting again.</p>

<div>
<h2>On-Campus Housing</h2>
<p>I would 100% recommend living in a dorm during your first year at UW-Madison, whether you are a freshman or a transfer student. There is no other situation that will define your UW-Madison experience quite as much as living in the dorms for a year.</p>
	<h3><a href="https://www.housing.wisc.edu/residence-halls/halls/neighborhoods/">Southeast or Lakeshore</a> - Where do you belong?</h3>
		<h4>Southeast Dorms</h4>

		<p>I may be biased, but Southeast is the place to be. Depending on your major, these dorms will be nearer to your classes. You will certainly be closer to the hustle and bustle of restaurants and shopping downtown. If you are a social butterly, you want to meet a million random people living in your dorm, and you don't mind a lot of noise, Southeast is probably the place for you.</p>

		<p>The Lakeshore dorms are typically much smaller than the Southeast dorms. This means you might not meet as many random people as you'd meet in Southeast, but you also have the chance to get really close with the people nearest to you. If you're into sports and outdoorsy stuff, this might be the spot for you, because the NAT is right next door, the lakeshore path is in your front yard, there are sand volleyball and tennis courts galore, and of course - plenty of trees for hammocking on the lake. You will be further from any type of night-time scene, but if you don't mind a good walk or taking the bus, you can have the best of both worlds.</p>

<h2>Off-Campus Housing</h2>
<p>Beyond your first year at UW-Madison, the cost of the dorms is simply not worth it (not that you'll find truly cheap housing anywhere else, but it's at least... better... off-campus. Other perks include <i>actually having a kitchen</i>, private bathrooms, and not having to worry about pesky Housefellows watching your every move!</p>
	<h3>Madison Near-Campus Neighborhoods</h3>
		<h4>State Street/Langdon</h4>
		<p>You can find a good mix of luxury high-rise and 100-year-old apartments over the top of State Street shops. This area is lively and noisy, especially Thursday through Saturday, but you're smack dab in the middle of everything! If you stick closer to Langdon Street, of course, you'll be in the midst of Greek Life.</p>
		<h4>Sophomore Slums</h4>
		<p>The Sophomore Slums are an affordable option for first time Madison renters. The location isn't bad in terms of access to classes, but you have a bit of a walk if you want to get downtown or over to friends' houses near Mifflin.</p>
		<h4>Mifflin</h4>
		<p>The Mifflin area mostly consists of older houses, but this area is fun if you want to live with a large group of people and have some outdoor space to enjoy when it's nice out.</p>
		<h4>Regent Street/Greenbush/Vilas</h4>
		<p>The Regent Street/Greenbush/Vilas neighborhoods are a nice area that might make you feel like you're part of the real Madison community - but keep in mind the price of Ubering if you tend to head for State Street or Mifflin.</p>
		<h4>Camp Randall</h4>
		<p>If Football is your thing and you're an engineering student, look no further - this is the spot for you.</p>
